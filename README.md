Mapping Work
============

For some clients, Anyways performs mapping services. As Anyways consists of a few OpenStreetMappers, quality should be good.
Mapping work is mostly done with work-accounts.

In this file, we describe what we have mapped (or will map) as 'paid mappers'. If you feel like we're doing a bad job, please get in touch. We should respond to message via the OSM accounts below.
