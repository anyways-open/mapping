Mapping Work
============

For some clients, Anyways performs mapping services. As Anyways consists of a few OpenStreetMappers, quality should be good.
Mapping work is mostly done with work-accounts.

In this file, we describe what we have mapped (or will map) as 'paid mappers'. If you feel like we're doing a bad job, please get in touch. We should respond to message via the OSM accounts below.

Projects
--------

- Cycling routes in Genk, for municipality Genk. See [this issue](https://github.com/anyways-open/cycling-backend/issues/9).
- The Functional Cycling Network Antwerp. [The original relation](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/9857490) (now only center) was split up into some subrelations after complaints that it easily causes changeset conflicts because it was so big. New relations are [1](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/11949823), [2](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/11949830), [3](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/11949839), [4](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/11949791), [5](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/11949791), [6](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/11949776)
